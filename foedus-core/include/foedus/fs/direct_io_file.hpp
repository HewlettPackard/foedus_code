 * @brief Represents an I/O stream on one file without filesystem caching.
 * @ingroup FILESYSTEM
 * @details
 * This class bypasses filesystem caching for disk I/O for three purposes.
 *  \li Performance, as DBMS has better knowledge of disk accesses than OS.
 *  \li Memory footprint, as we might end up doubled memory consumption.
 *  \li Durability, as write-cache would undermine the synchronous flush during commit.
 *
 * This class is used for two kinds of files.
 *  \li Data file, or snapshot files.
 *  \li Log file
 * @todo Support Windows. MUCH later.
