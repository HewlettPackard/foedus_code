/**
 * @defgroup INITIALIZABLE Initialize/Uninitialize Resources
 * @ingroup IDIOMS
 * @brief Defines a uniform class interface to initialize/uninitialize non-trivial resources.
 * @details
 * @par Constructor/Destructor vs initialize()/uninitialize()
 * Constructor should not do complicated initialization as it can't return errors.
 * Instead, we universally use initialize()/uninitialize() semantics for all long-living objects.
 * By long-living, we mean at least seconds. Small and short-living objects do not have to
 * follow this semantics as it might cause unnecessary complexity or overhead.
 *
 * Same applies to Destructor vs uninitialize(). Furthermore, C++ doesn't allow calling
 * virtual functions (uninitialize()) in destructor as the class information was already torn down!
 * So, make sure you always explicitly call uninitialize().
 * If you didn't call uninitialize(), you actually leak the resource.
 *
 * @par DefaultInitializable
 * For most classes, you can use DefaultInitializable class to save repetitive code.
 * For example, declare your class like the following:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * class YourClass : public DefaultInitializable {
 *  public:
 *     YourClass(const ConfigurationForYourClass &conf, int other_params, ...);
 *     ...
 *     ErrorStack  initialize_once() CXX11_OVERRIDE;
 *     ErrorStack  uninitialize_once() CXX11_OVERRIDE;
 * };
 * @endcode
 * Then, define initialize_once()/uninitialize_once() as follows in cpp.
 * @code{.cpp}
 * ErrorStack  YourClass::initialize_once() {
 *    .... // one-time initialization for this object
 *    return kRetOk;
 * }
 * ErrorStack  YourClass::uninitialize_once() {
 *    // one-time uninitialization for this object. continue releasing resources even when
 *    // there is some error. So, use ErrorStackBatch to wrap more than one errors.
 *    ErrorStackBatch batch;
 *    batch.emplace_back(some_uninitialization());
 *    batch.emplace_back(another_uninitialization());
 *    batch.emplace_back(yet_another_uninitialization());
 *    return SUMMARIZE_ERROR_BATCH(batch);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par UninitializeGuard, or how RAII fails in real world.
 * The code that instantiates an Initializable object must call uninitialize() for the reasons
 * above. Even if there is some error, which causes an early return from the function
 * by CHECK_ERROR() in many cases. Note that try-catch(...) does not work because this is NOT an
 * exception (and we never use exceptions in our code). \e YOU have to make sure uninitialize()
 * is called.
 * UninitializeGuard addresses this issue, \b but \b imperfectly. For example, use it like this:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * ErrorStack your_func() {
 *     YourInitializable object;
 *     CHECK_ERROR(object.initialize());
 *     {
 *         UninitializeGuard guard(&object, UninitializeGuard::kWarnIfUninitializeError);
 *         CHECK_ERROR(object.do_something());
 *         CHECK_ERROR(object.uninitialize());
 *     }
 * }
 * @endcode
 * The UninitializeGuard object automatically calls object.uninitialize() when do_something()
 * fails and we return from your_func(). \b HOWEVER, C++'s destructor can't propagate any errors,
 * in our case ErrorStack. The second argument (UninitializeGuard::kWarnIfUninitializeError)
 * says that if it encounters an error while uninitialize() call, it just warns it in debug log.
 * Logging the error is not a perfect solution at all. So, this is just an imperfect safety net.
 * Unfortunately, this is all what we can do in C++ for objects that have non-trivial release.
