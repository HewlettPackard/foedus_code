/**
 * @brief Represents memory shared between processes.
 * @ingroup MEMORY
 * @details
 * This class was initially a part of AlignedMemory, but we separated it out to reflect the
 * special semantics of this type of memory.
 *
 * @par Alloc/dealloc type
 * As this is a shared memory, there is only one choice unlike AlignedMemory.
 * We always use shmget() with SHM_HUGETLB and shmat()/shmdt().
 *
 * @par Pros/cons of System-V shmget()
 * We made this choice of share memory allocation API after trying all available options.
 * The biggest pro of System-V shmget is that it does not need to mount a hugetlbfs for
 * allocating hugepages. The cons are that it can't exceed kernel.shmmax and also we have to
 * do a linux-dependent trick to reliably release the shared memory.
 * For other choices, see the sections below.
 *
 * @par Ownership
 * Every shared memory is allocated and owned by the master process.
 * Forked/execed child processes, whether they are 'emulated' processes or not, do not have
 * ownership thus should not release them at exit.
 *
 * @par Moveable/Copiable
 * This object is \e NOT copiable.
 * This object \e is moveable (the original object becomes null after the move).
 *
 * @par Why not POSIX shm_open()
 * It can't use hugepages, period. shm_open is preferable because it's POSIX standard and also
 * allows friendly naming to uniquefy the shared memory unlike shmget()'s integer ID.
 * However, so far it doesn't allow hugepages and also we have to manually delete the file
 * under /dev/shm.
 *
 * @par Why not open() and mmap() with MAP_SHARED
 * It requires mounting hugetlbfs and also the user has to specify the path of the mounted
 * file system in our configuration. This open/mmap is preferable because it is not affected
 * by kernel.shmmax, which was an 'oversight' and might be corrected later, though. See the
 * LWN article.
 *
 * @par Why not mmap() with MAP_PRIVATE and MAP_SHARED
 * To allow sharing memory between arbitrary processes, we need non-private shared memory.
 *
 * @par Debugging shared memories
 * ipcs -m
 * ipcrm, etc etc.
 *
 * @par Valgrind, shmat, and hugepages
 * Seems like valgrind has a bug on shmat with hugepages.
 * I filed a bug report, not sure how it will be resolved.
 * This causes all valgrind execution to fail on almost all testcases, crap.
 * As a tentative work around, I check whether we are running on valgrind and, if so, get rid
 * of SHM_HUGETLB from shmget call. Just for this reason, we have to include valgrind headers.
 * gggrrrr.
