/**
 * @brief A log-gleaner, which constructs a new set of snapshot files during snapshotting.
 * @ingroup SNAPSHOT
 * @details
 * @section GLEANER_OVERVIEW Log Gleaner Overview
 * LogGleaner is the main class that manages most mechanisms to construct a new set of snapshot
 * files. Snapshot procedure constructs and calls this object during snapshot.
 * It receives partitioning policy (which snapshot partitions to send ranges of keys) per storage
 * and beginning/ending epoch of logs to \e glean while log-gleaning.
 *
 * Log-gleaning consists of two components; \b mapper (foedus::snapshot::LogMapper) and \b reducer
 * (foedus::snapshot::LogReducer), obviously named after the well-known map-reduce concepts.
 *
 * @section GLEANER_MAPPER Mapper
 * LogGleaner launches a set of mapper threads (foedus::snapshot::LogMapper) to read log files.
 * Each LogMapper corresponds to foedus::log::Logger, the NUMA-local log writer which simply writes
 * out log entries produced by local worker threads.
 * Thus, the log files contain log entries that might be sent to any partitions.
 * LogMapper \e maps each log entry to some partition and send it to a reducer corresponding to the
 * partition. For more details, see foedus::snapshot::LogMapper.
 *
 * @section GLEANER_REDUCER Reducer
 * LogGleaner also launches a set of reducer threads (foedus::snapshot::LogReducer), one for each
 * NUMA node. LogReducer sorts log entries sent from LogMapper.
 * The log entries are sorted by key and ordinal (*), then processed just like
 * usual APPLY at the end of transaction, but on top of snapshot files.
 *
 * (*) otherwise correct result is not guaranteed. For example, imagine the following case:
 *  \li UPDATE rec-1 to A. Log-ordinal 1.
 *  \li UPDATE rec-1 to B. Log-ordinal 2.
 *
 * Ordinal-1 must be processed before ordinal 2.
 *
 * @section GLEANER_SYNC Synchronization
 * LogGleaner coordinates the synchronization between mappers and reducers during snapshotting.
 * At the beginning of snapshotting, gleaner wakes up reducers and mappers. Mappers go in to sleep
 * when they process all logs. When all mappers went to sleep, reducers start to
 * also go into sleep when they process all logs they receive.
 * When all of them are done, gleaner initiates the last wrap-up phase.
 * Additionally, LogGleaner is in charge of receiving termination request from the engine
 * if the user invokes Engine::uninitialize() and requesting reducers/mappers to stop.
 *
 * Reducers/mappers occasionally check if they are requested to stop when they get idle or complete
 * all work. They do the check at least once for a while so that the latency to stop can not be
 * catastrophic.
 *
 * @section GLEANER_ROOT Constructing Root Pages
 * After all mappers and reducers complete, the last phase of log gleaning is to construct
 * root pages for the storages modified in this snapshotting.
 * Gleaner collects \e root-page-info from each reducer and combines them to create the
 * root page(s). When all set, gleaner produces maps from storage ID to a new root page ID.
 * This will be written out in a snapshot metadata file by snapshot manager.
 *
 * @note
 * This is a private implementation-details of \ref SNAPSHOT, thus file name ends with _impl.
 * Do not include this header from a client program. There is no case client program needs to
 * access this internal class.
