/**
 * @brief A log reducer, which receives log entries sent from mappers
 * and applies them to construct new snapshot files.
 * @ingroup SNAPSHOT
 * @details
 * @section REDUCER_OVERVIEW Overview
 * Reducers receive log entries from mappers and apply them to new snapshot files.
 *
 * @section SORTING Sorting
 * The log entries are sorted in a few steps to be processed efficiently and simply.
 * Sorting starts when one of the reducer's buffer becomes full.
 * Reducer never starts sorting until that to maximize the benefits of batch-processing
 * (this design might be revisited later, though).
 * Reducers maintain two buffers to let mappers keep sending data while reducers are sorting
 * and dumping to temporary files.
 *
 * @subsection STORAGE-SORT Storage Sorting
 * The first step is to sort log entries by storage, which is done in mappers.
 * We process all log entries of one storage together.
 * This has a benefit of code simplicity and less D-cache misses.
 * We don't actually sort in this case because we don't care the order between
 * storages. Thus, we use hashmap-like structure in mappers to sort based on storage-id.
 *
 * Upon receiving a chunk of data from mappers, the reducer has to collect all of them
 * to do the following (otherwise the sorting is incomplete). This is done by simply reading
 * all block headers utilizing the block_length_ property.
 * Assuming each block is sufficiently large, this jumping cost on DRAM should be negligible.
 * If each block is not sufficiently large, there are anyway other performance issues.
 *
 * @subsection KEY-ORDINAL-SORT Key and Ordinal Sorting
 * Then, in each storage, we sort logs by keys and then by ordinal (*).
 * The algorithm to do this sorting depends on the storage type (eg Array, Masstree)
 * because some storage has a VERY efficient way to do this.
 * We exploit the fact that this sorting occurs only per storage, just passing the whole
 * log entries for the storage to storage-specific logic defined in foedus::storage::Partitioner.
 * This is another reason to sort by storage first.
 *
 * (*) We do need to sort by ordinal. Otherwise correct result is not guaranteed.
 * For example, imagine the following case:
 *  \li UPDATE rec-1 to A. Log-ordinal 1.
 *  \li UPDATE rec-1 to B. Log-ordinal 2.
 * Ordinal-1 must be processed before ordinal 2.
 *
 * For more details, see foedus::storage::Partitioner.
 *
 * @subsection DUMP-MERGE Dumping Logs and and Merging
 * After the sorting, the reducer dumps the buffer to a file.
 * When all logs are received, the reducer does merge-sort on top of the sorted run files.
 *
 * @subsection COMPACTING Compacting Logs
 * In some cases, we can delete log entries for the same keys.
 * For example, when we have two logs for the same key like the example above, we can safely
 * omit the first log with ordinal 1 AS FAR AS both logs appear in the same reducer buffer
 * and updated byte positions in the record are the same.
 * Another example is updates followed by a deletion.
 *
 * This compaction is especially useful for a record that is repeatedly updated/inserted/deleted,
 * such as TPC-C's WAREHOUSE/DISTRICT records, where several thousands of overwrite-logs
 * in each reducer buffer will be compacted into just one log.
 *
 * See foedus::storage::Partitioner::sort_batch() for more details.
 *
 * @section DATAPAGES Data Pages
 * One tricky thing in reducer is how it manages data pages to read previous snapshot pages
 * and apply the new logs. So far, we assume each reducer allocates a sufficient amount of
 * DRAM to hold all pages it read/write during one snapshotting.
 * If this doesn't hold, we might directly allocate pages on NVRAM and read/write there.
 *
 * @note
 * This is a private implementation-details of \ref SNAPSHOT, thus file name ends with _impl.
 * Do not include this header from a client program. There is no case client program needs to
 * access this internal class.
 *
 * @todo This class got a bit bloated and hard to do a whitebox test because of dependencies
 * to other modules. Dump-part and merge-part should be separated into its own classes in a way
 * testcases can independently test them. Maybe reducer should be its own package?
