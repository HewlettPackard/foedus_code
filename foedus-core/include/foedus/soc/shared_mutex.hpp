 * @brief A mutex that can be placed in shared memory and used from multiple processes.

 * @details
 * C++11's mutex doesn't work for multi-process.
 * We need to directly manipulate pthread_mutexattr_setpshared, hence this class.
 * This object is also shared-memory friendly, meaning it has no heap-allocated member.
 * It can be reset to a usable state via memset(zero), too.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * SharedMutex mtx;
 * mtx.initialize();  // omit this if you invoked constructor. be careful on reinterpret_cast
 * mtx.lock();
 * do_something();
 * mtx.unlock();  // or automatically released when mtx gets out of scope
 * mtx.uninitialize();  // same above, but not the end of the world
 * @endcode
