/**
 * @brief Represents a logic to compose a new version of data pages for one storage.
 * @ingroup STORAGE SNAPSHOT
 * @details
 * @section COMPOSER_OVERVIEW Overview
 * This object is one of the liaisons between \ref SNAPSHOT module and \ref STORAGE module.
 * It receives previous snapshot files and pre-sorted log entries from snapshot module,
 * then applies a storage-specific implementation to convert them into a new version of data pages.
 * Every interface is batched and completely separated from the normal transactional processing
 * part. In fact, this object is not part of foedus::storage::Storage at all.
 *
 * @section COMPOSER_SCOPE Composer's scope
 * One composer object is in charge of data pages that meet \b all of following criteria:
 *  \li In one storage
 *  \li In one partition (in one NUMA node)
 *  \li In one snapshot
 *
 * None of these responsibilities is overlapping, so the job of composer is totally independent
 * from other composers \b except the root page of the storage.
 *
 * @section COMPOSER_INPUTS Inputs
 * Every composer receives the following when constructed.
 *  \li Corresponding Partitioner object that tells what pages this composer is responsible for.
 *  \li Pre-allocated and reused working memory (assured to be on the same NUMA node).
 *  \li Pre-sorted stream(s) of log entries (foedus::snapshot::SortedBuffer).
 *  \li Snapshot writer to allocate pages and write them out to a snapshot file.
 *  \li Most recent snapshot files.
 *
 * @section COMPOSER_OUTPUTS Outputs
 * Composers emit the following data when it's done.
 *  \li Composed data pages, which are written to the snapshot file by the snapshot writer.
 *  \li For each storage and for each second-level page that is pointed from the root page,
 * the snapshot pointer and relevant pointer information (eg key range).
 * We call this information as \e root-info and store them in a tentative page.
 * This is required to construct the root page at the end of snapshotting.
 *
 * @section COMPOSER_INSTALL Installing Composed Pages
 * At the end of snapshotting, composers install pointers to the snapshot pages they composed.
 * These are written to the snapshot pointer part of DualPagePointer so that transactions
 * can start using the snapshot pages.
 * Composers also drop volatile pointers if possible, reducing pressures to volatile page pool.
 *
 * @par Shared memory, No virtual methods
 * Like Partitioner, no virtual methods allowed. We just do switch-case.

   * in volatile pages. In long run, it will be done at next snapshot,
   * so it's okay to be opportunistic.
