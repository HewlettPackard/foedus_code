/**
 * @brief Output of one compose() call, which are then combined in construct_root().
 * @ingroup HASH
 * @details
 * The format is exactly same as HashIntermediatePage, but typedef-ed for clarity. The only
 * differences are:
 * \li Snapshot pointer points to HashComposedBinsPage instead of HashDataPage/HashIntermediatePage.
 * \li Volatile pointer (which of course is never used in snapshot page) instead represents the
 * number of contiguously-written HashComposedBinsPage in the pointed sub-tree. This allows the
 * combiner to read the entire linked-list in one-shot.
 *
 * @par Linked list of HashComposedBinsPage
 * In hash storage, what compose() returns are just a list of bins.
 * There essentially is no structure of them.
 * The only reason we have this "root" page is to allow parallel combination by the gleaner.
 * Each child-pointer from the root page is assigned to one thread on its own node,
 * then written out in that node. So, after following the first child pointer, we just
 * need a linked list, which is HashComposedBinsPage.
 *
 * @par 2-path composition
 * Each reducer returns a linked-list of HashComposedBinsPage for every direct-child of the
 * root page. Then, the gleaner combines them in a parallel fashion, resulting in snapshot
 * interemediate pages that will be installed to the root page.
 * The second phase consists of reading the HashComposedBinsPage from each composer (reducer),
 * collecting updated bins on each page, and creating a new interemediate page hierarchically.
 * We have several classes decoupled from the composer class itself as listed below:
 * \li ComposedBin (individual bin)
 * \li HashComposedBinsPage  (hundreds of bins)
 * \li ComposedBinsBuffer (all bins from a sub-tree emit from one composer)
 * \li ComposedBinsMergedStream (all bins from a sub-tree emit from all composers)
 *
 * @par 1-level hashtable
 * It works the same way even when the hash table has only one level (root directly points to data
 * pages). Even in this case, HashRootInfoPage still points to HashComposedBinsPage,
 * which contains only one entry per page. Kind of wasteful, but it has negligible overheads
 * compared to the entire mapper/reducer.
 * Unlike array package, we don't do special optimization for this case in order to keep the code
 * simpler, and because the storage could benefit from parallelization even in this case
 * (the root page still contains hundreds of hash bins).
