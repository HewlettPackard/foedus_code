 * @par About root_snapshot_page_id
 * In sequential storage, root_snapshot_page_id points to the \e head of stable root pages.
 * A sequential storage has zero or more stable root pages (SequentialRootPage) that form a
 * singly-linked list. Each of them contains a number of page pointers to head pages.
 * In reality, most sequential storage should have only one root page which has only a few
 * head pages.
 *
 * When this pointer is zero, there is no stable head page.
 *
 * This page pointer is not dual page pointer because we never have volatile (modify-able)
 * root pages. All the volatile part are stored as the in-memory append-only list, which is
 * totally orthogonal to snapshot pages.
