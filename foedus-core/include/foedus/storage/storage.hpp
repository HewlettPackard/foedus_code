 * The derived class defines \e how they are stored.
 *
 * @section ST Storage vs Tables/Indexes
 * One \e storage corresponds to one set of key-value pairs.
 * A relational \e Table consists of one or more storages, primary storage and zero or more
 * secondary storages (secondary indexes).
 * However, libfoedus-core is agnostic to relational layer. It only knows about key-value store.
 * The relation between primary and secondary storages are controlled by higher layers.
 *
 * @section INSTANTIATE Instantiating Storage
 * Storage object is instantiated in two ways.
 * To newly create a storage, the user invokes storage manager's create_xxx, which instantiates
 * this object and calls create().
 * To retrieve an existing storage, bluh bluh
