/**
 * @brief An analogue of pthread's condition variable and std::condition_variable to avoid glibc's
 * bug in pthread_cond_broadcast/signal (thus in notify_all/one in turn).
 * @ingroup THREAD
 * @details
 * The whole purpose of this class is to workaound a bug in glibc's pthread_cond_broadcast/signal(),
 * which is also used by std::condition_variable.
 *
 * The bug is already fixed here:
 *   https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=8f630cca5c36941db1cb48726016bbed80ec1041
 * However, it will not be available until glibc 2.20, which will be employed in major linux distros
 * much much later. So, we work around the issue ourselves for a while.
 *
 * Seems like the issue is not only about broadcast. I'm observing issues if we might call
 * notify_one while there is no waiter (which should be totally valid, but then something gets
 * occasionally broken.) So, whether you have at most one waiter not, we should use this class
 * always. Do not use std::condition_variable at all.
 *
 * As this depends on C++11, the name of this file ends with impl. Thus, only private implementation
 * classes directly use this class. If you are okay with C++11, you can use it from client programs,
 * too.
 *
 * This class is totally header-only.
