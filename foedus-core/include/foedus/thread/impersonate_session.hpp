/**
 * @brief A user session running on an \e impersonated thread.
 * @ingroup THREADPOOL
 * @details
 * @par Overview
 * This object represents an impersonated session, which is obtained by calling
 * ThreadPool#impersonate() and running the given task on a pre-allocated thread.
 * This object also works as a \e future to synchronously or asynchronously
 * wait for the completion of the functor from the client program's thread.
 *
 * @par Result of Impersonation
 * The client program has to first check is_valid() for the given session because
 * there are two possible cases as the result of impersonation.
 *  \li Impersonation succeded (is_valid()==true), running the task on the impersonated thread.
 * In this case, the client's thread (original thread that invoked ThreadPool#impersonate()) can
 * either wait for the end of the impersonated thread (call wait() or wait_for()),
 * or do other things (e.g., launch more impersonated threads).
 *
 *  \li Impersonation failed (is_valid()==false). This might happen for various reasons; timeout,
 * the engine shuts down while waiting, unexpected errors, etc.
 * In this case, get_invalid_cause() indicates the causes of the failed impersonation.
 *
 * @par Wait for the completion of the session
 * When is_valid()==true, this object also behaves as std::shared_future<ErrorStack>,
 * and we actually use it. But, because of the \ref CXX11 issue, we wrap it as a usual class.
 * This object is copiable like std::shared_future, not std::future.
 * Actually, this class is based on std::shared_future just to provide copy semantics
 * for non-C++11 clients. Additional overheads shouldn't matter, hopeully.
 *
 * @par Copy/Move
 * This object is not copy-able because the destructor closes the session in shared memory.
 * However, it is moveable, which moves the ownership (available only with C++11 though).
