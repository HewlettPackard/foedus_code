 * @brief The frequently appearing quartet of std::thread, condition_varible, stop-request flag,
 * and mutex.
 * @ingroup THREAD
 * @details
 * This quartet helps implement a thread that consumes some task and also occasionally checks
 * if someone requested to stop this thread.
 * As this depends on C++11, the name of this file ends with impl. Thus, only private implementation
 * classes directly use this class. If you are okay with C++11, you can use it from client programs,
 * too.
 *
 * @todo initialize() should only set thread. We should separate other initialization from it
 * because the new thread might be already accessing those properties
 * (at least valgrind is unhappy). We should have 'launch()' method instead.
